I like minecraft 1.7.3. I find it charming. Nuff said.

I also like problem solving and automation.

One could simply create a machine that prints diamonds. There is no fun in that.

Resource gathering is often time consuming. Providing a way to increase the
yield of gathered resources is very valuable.

Most mods start with some grinder that can double ore output. Some have
mechanisms to then 3x or 4x the output, but often feel like diminishing returns.

That initial 2x is probably feels like the most impactful jump.
